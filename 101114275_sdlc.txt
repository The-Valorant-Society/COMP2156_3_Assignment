It's important to know DevOps as it teaches best practices for coding in a group setting.

DevOps is crucial to learn in order to have a proper development cycle out in the real world for both small and large projects.

Without knowing/learning DevOps doing coding in a group environment will be a lot harder and you will not know the best practices when
it comes to properly keeping track of versions and changes made along the way.
